EXPLAINATION:
The config exporter creates an export of the current composer development configuration and pushes each new configuration to Fingrid implementation.

BEFORE YOU START!
1. Make sure you have an newer version of git installed on your local machine
2. Make sure that you have the Fingrid project installed on "C:\Projects\CMS\sources\Fingrid" location (which is the default location)
3. Make sure you have an internet connection (zscaler on / ivanti on)
4. Make sure you are not in your own branch and don't have any current changes (the program will warn you about this). If you do commit + push them in advance or use git stash

STARTING THE CONFIG EXPORTER
Go to file explorer -> config export location and double click 'start.bat'. Sit back and enjoy.
